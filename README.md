"# otp_verification"
As the project heading describes us the things that we are going to perform in this project.
We have used fast2sms for sending the messages and we integrated it with nodejs.
So , a user can register and get an otp..
Further the otp will be verified at the time of otp_verification.
We are also setting the jwtTokens once the user enter otp  is verified.
